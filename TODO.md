# To-Do List

- [x] reimplement subgroup/generator stuff from chapter 5, do exercises

- [ ] clean up Group tests

- [ ] implement permutation element transposition-decompositions and products

- [ ] restructure "examples" (need better name) into their submodules (Dn, Sn, octonion binary operation)

- [ ] consolidate use of `bin_op`/`group` vs `Function`/`Group`

- [ ] change `Function.__repr__` to say something about the `bin_op` signature?

- [ ] use Cayley-Dickson construction to build algebra complex-octonion

- [ ] move table string generation to a multiplication table viewer
